### Description

On PSC I saw this stragety game so I wanted to make my own. I did make one and I also think that it is pretty good. There is kinda of a help file and you can read the Meanings.txt if you need further help. I could go on and on about my game, but I think it is better if you play it then just read about it. Please leave comments and votes. Have fun and thanks in Advance.
